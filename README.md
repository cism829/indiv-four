# Individual Assignment 4: CRUD App 


## How to run: http://localhost:8080/goals/all

### The database table is under "c-goal"

There are buttons for deleting and editing the individual tasks and goals
(Within the task detail page, the go back button will redirect you back to 
the overall goal list page, not goal detail page).

Clicking on the ID's for a Goal or for a Task will give you its individual
details. 

Entering a task or goal without putting in a userId will result in error.

For multiple deletions/updates, you may have to refresh the page in 
between each update or deletion.

Within the table the individual tasks will show that they belong to a specfic 
goal id, however within the app itself it will not differentiate. 
Meaning under goal details it gives a list of all tasks instead of all tasks 
to that indivual goal.
